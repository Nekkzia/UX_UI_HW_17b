        I am a Toronto based UX designer who is working on 
          creating marvelous feature-rich high fidelity designs.
    
          I believe that nothing thrives unless it simplifies
           human effort, and only the user holds the reigns to that verdict. 
           That is where my design realm exists: human-centric and user-driven. 
           And there lies my goalâ”€ to design for my users intuitively and interactively.
          
          From the inception of my concept, I realized that
           design was my calling. That is the prime reason why 
           I put my heart and soul into each new project, and this
            intense passion for user-centric design is reflected in myhighly 
            varied portfolio which I try to make exceptional. For a better idea of this designer style
             and capabilities, please have a look at their past work below
